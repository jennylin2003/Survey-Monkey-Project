R Essenial Training 
Statistical applications such as SPSS, SAS, and Jamovi are user point-and-click interfaces for data exploration/modeling. 
Data-oriented programming language give us the ultimate control/power in analyzing our data when data is not nicely fit in rows/columns OR questions beyond the procedures that are available in drop down menus
Python (well-adapted for working w data), Julia (intriguing newcomer in scientific computing), and R (language specifically for working with data).
I. Entering data
a <- 1 # individiual values
x <- c(1,2,5,9) # c = combine/collect/concatenate, multiple values
# SEQUENCES
0:10, 10:0, seq(10)  # 1-10, seq(30,0, by = -3 # Count down by 3 

Learning Contents:
Intro: What is R? Packages, piping commands w/ %>%, tidyverse, comments and headers, data types & structures,
navigating RStudio environment

Importing Data: built-in datasets, exploring datasets w/ pacman, XML, JSON, saving data (native R formats)
Visualizing Data w/ ggplot2: colors, color palettes, bar charts, histograms, box plots, scatterplots, multiple graphs, cluster charts

Structure of ggplot2 Commands
ggplot(data = <DATA> ) + <GEOM_FUNCTION> (mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>), stat = <STAT>, position = <POSITION>) + <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> + <FACET_FUNCTION>

qplot commands for quicker work but with less power and control 

Wrangling Data: tidy data, using tibbles, data.table, converting wide to tall data and from tall to wide, tables to rows, dates & times, list data, XML,
categorical variables, filtering cases & subgroups

ESSENTIALS OF TIDY DATA
#1. Column == Variable/field/attribute
#2. Row == Case/observation
#3. Cell == Single value encoded with text or numbers 
#4. File == One level of observation/abstraction

Tibble = variation of table, enhanced version of data frame. Facilitate certain commands. Must have tidyverse to use.

Recoding Data: recoding categorical data, quanitative data, transforming outliers, creating scale scores by counting/averaging
